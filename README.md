### Responsiveness and animations
- **Responsiveness**: Implemented with Tailwind responsive utilities (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) for typography, spacing, grid columns, and layout adjustments across breakpoints.
- **Animations/Transitions**:
  - Subtle UI transitions using Tailwind classes like `transition-all`, `duration-300`, and `transform` for hover/press effects (e.g., button scale on hover).
  - Scroll-tied transforms in sections such as `HeroSection` and `ConversationSection` by computing `scale` and `translateY` from `scrollY` and applying inline `transform` styles for smooth parallax-like motion.
